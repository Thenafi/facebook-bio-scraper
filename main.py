# this is the main that first gathers the profile url
# and then runs the bio gathering process
# its a bit slow process bceasue you will get temoporary block by facebook if you collect bio faster

# to contol it change the timer(range) in getting_bio  line 44 (wait variable)


# NOTE Sample.json file is the main output or databse..  where all your data will be stored
# after running the programe use the
# updated file and convert it to our needs
# NOTE if there is no crd.json file create one like this https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/ShareX2022/ShareX/Code_kCSU7eE5BC.png
#  it holds your password and id


# checking if you have the Sample.json file.. if not  import profile will run and create the json file
meh = os.path.isfile("./Sample.json")

if meh != True:
    print("Collecting Profile Url")
    profile()
    print("Bio Collection Starting")
    bio()
else:
    print("Bio Collection Starting")
    bio()
